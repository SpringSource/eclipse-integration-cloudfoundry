## Application Debugging in Cloud Foundry Eclipse

  Application debugging is currently experimental and uses ngrok.com, and as of 1.8.1, applicable only to standalone Java applications, for example a Spring Boot app packaged as jar. Debugging feature is ongoing work and may change in future versions, including dropping ngrok.com support. The links below may also change.
